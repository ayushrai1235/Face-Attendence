The main desktop app file is face-attendence-app.py
for running the app run this '
pip install PyQt5 opencv-python face_recognition firebase-admin numpy cvzone 
' to install the required things.
but desktop app file only takes the attendance once and stops so to see the real program concept you have to run main.py 
also the Images folder contain the images of the students we are going to identify and to add a new student you can use the add new student feature in face-attendence-app.py
