The main desktop app file is face-attendence-app.py
for running the app run this '
pip install PyQt5 opencv-python face_recognition firebase-admin numpy cvzone 
' to install the required things.
but desktop app file only takes the attendance once and stops so to see the real program concept you have to run main.py
